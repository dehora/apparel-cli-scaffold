Welcome!

Help is always welcome. First, please make to sure to read and observe our [Code
of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.MD). After that, here is how you can get started.

### Find a good first topic

Please see the issue tracker for things to work on. The `help-wanted` label
has a list of things that would be pretty cool to have, and fun to work on. The
codebase follows [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

We love to see the quality of things improving as well as adding new
features. For example, documentation (like the text you are reading now) can
always use improvement. There's always code that can be clarified and variables
or functions that can be renamed or commented. There's always a need for more
test coverage. If you see something you think should be fixed and could be
better, you can own its improvement.

### Say what you want to work on

Before making a contribution, please let us know by posting a comment to the
relevant issue. If you would like to propose a new feature, please create a new
issue first explaining the feature youâ€™d like to contribute, problem you want to
solve, or bug you want to fix.
